KIWI
====

The openSUSE KIWI Image System provides a complete operating
system image solution for Linux supported hardware platforms as
well as for virtualization systems like Xen, VMware, etc. The KIWI
architecture was designed as a two level system. The first stage,
based on a valid software package source, creates a so called 
unpacked image according to the provided image description.
The second stage creates from a required unpacked image an
operating system image. The result of the second stage is called
a packed image or short an image.
