# kiwi oemboot descriptions
# The boot images here are used for initial boot of an OEM system
# This means the OEM system is created a virtual disk including
# the boot manager, the oemboot boot image and the real OEM system
# image. Once this image has been deployed onto a real disk some
# actions have to take place, like repartitioning of the disk
# creating standard initrd, setting up the bootloader, etc...
# All this is done within the oemboot image
#
# Note:
# Do not use this boot image with another image type than vmx or oem !
