The process and flow of information starts with the command parser and 
"executable" kiwi.pl. When packages kiwi.pl changes to kiwi. The main
objective of the parser is to collect all the command line data, create
the command line object, implemented in KIWICommandline.pm, and then start
the image build process by instantiating the image creator, implemented in
KIWIImageCreator.pm. Based on the information in the command line object the
image creator makes decisions about the actions to take and orchestrates the
image build procedure.

Kiwi implements a logging facility in KIWILog.pm which is implemented as a
Singleton. All classes in KIWI log messages and thus the Singleton
implementation of the logger allows us to access the log object from any
location in the code without having to pass the object around.
