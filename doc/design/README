This directory contains a number of files describing the design concepts used
in KIWI. The idea is to make it easier for those that want to contribute to
understand the flow of data and how things fit together.

Some of the documentation provides the intend of the design, i.e. the
documentation might describe the way we want the code to be organized rather
than the way the code is implemented at present. There are no special hints
or warnings in the design documentation that indicate whether the
documentation represents the "is" or "wants" state. The onus is on the reader
to take a look at the code and he documentation and understand the
difference in state between "is" and "want". If in doubt seek help on the
mailing list kiwi-images@googlegroups.com.
